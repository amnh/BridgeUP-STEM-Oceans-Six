# Happy Valentine's Day! 

## Today, we'll try to wrap up our plots of sea level anomaly using for loops.

### Here's a checklist of what you have accomplished and still need to do.

- [x] Plot sea level anomaly from our dataset with the pcolor function
- [x] Write a function that plots SLA for any given day
- [x] Convert our dates variable from "`x` days since Jan. 1, 1950' to a mm/dd/yyyy format (i.e. 01-01-1993)
- [x] Use str.format to change the plot title in our function depending on the day argument
- [ ] Use str.format and our converted dates variable to make the plot date aware (i.e. printing `SLA on 1/1/1993`, rather than `SLA on day 1`)
- [ ] Save the output of our plot within our function
- [ ] Write a for loop with our function inside, so that we can plot all of our data at once!
- [ ] Pick the range of our for loop so that we only plot a single year of data. Each pair can pick their own year.
- [ ] Run code!
- [ ] Make movie!
