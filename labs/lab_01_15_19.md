We will use for loops to save plots of our data at every single date in our time variable. 

#### Objectives

#### 1. Python has a cool tool for creating strings with variable values. 
For example, if I want to print out a string that contains someone's name and age, I can write `"My name is {} and I am {} years old".format('Katy', 24)`. The great part about this is that we can change the input to be anything, without having to rewrite the entire string or add strings together.

  Read more about the [str.format function here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-format-function/). With your partner, practice writing a string that takes in (a) one variable input, (b) two variables inputs, (c) three variable inputs, and (d) two variable inputs that have an order  (see Code #4 in the link). 
  
#### 2. Write a for loop that loops over the names of your fellow interns and prints out "_______ is a intern in Ocean's Six" (replacing the ____ with an intern's name).

#### 3. Now, let's apply what we have learned about str.format and for loops.

  Our goal is to write a script that plots and saves sea level anomaly for each date in our dataset.
  
  ##### **a.** Open your Python script that plots sea level anomaly for a single day as a function of latitude and longitude. 
  Resave it with a new title that has the words "loop" and "SLA" and your initials in it.
  
  ##### **b.** With your partner, let's write  [pseudocode](https://sites.google.com/a/ismanila.org/oliverab_cp/python/pseudocode) for the for loop you want to create. 
  
  First, what value are you looping over (i.e., what value should change with every iteration)? 
  
  Next, what processes do you want to repeat for each value in your loop? 
  
  Now, can you put those two steps together and write it down as pseudocode? Don't worry about using correct Python syntax. You should **Slack me your pseudocode once you and your partner are done.**
  
  ##### **c.** Now, implement that pseudocode you just wrote as Python code. 
  You may be able to use [the range function](https://www.pythoncentral.io/pythons-range-function-explained/), which we discussed at the beginning of the year.
  
  ##### **d.** Run your code for a small subset of our date range. 
  This is a good practice in debugging, because it allows us to test just a few iterations of the for loop. What happens? Try to find the saved plots in Finder or Terminal. 
  
  ##### **e.** How can you save each plot with a unique file name? 
  (Hint: Remember str.format!) <br/>
  After making this change, try running your code  (again, with only a small subset of our date range)
  
  ##### **f.** Let's make the titles of our plots more descriptive.
  Time to bring actual dates in. Find the code you wrote to convert the time variable in our dataset to a list of dates (mm/dd/yyyy). Copy it into your script. 
  
  Now, write a sample plot title that includes the date of observation, using str.format. How are you selecting the appropriate date to use?
  
  Incorporate this varying plot title back into your for loop. 
  
  ##### **g.** Bonus: Can you use str.format and your dates variable to include the observation date in the plot's file name? 
  
  i.e., SLA_Bermuda_1993-12-12.plotting
  
  ##### **h**. Extra bonus: Converting dates back to strings.
  Python has two features: strptime and strftime, that allow us to convert from these `datetime` objects to strings and vice versa. Using [strftime](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/datetime/strftime) on a datetime object allows us to print it out in any string format we want. For example, we can take the datetime object `datetime.date(2019,1,15)` and use `.strftime` on it to return just the year (2019). We can also return the date like this, `1/15/2019`, or this, `Jan. 15, 2019` or any other format we choose. 
  
  **Practice**: Create a datetime object for Jan. 15, 2019, and use strftime to write code that returns `1/15/2019`, `Jan. 15, 2019` and just the year `2019`. Check out [strftime](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/datetime/strftime) and its [references](http://strftime.org/). 
  
  Now, choose your own format for the observation dates in our dataset, and adjust your for loop to display the date in this format in the plot title.
